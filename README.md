# 3rd Year Project
# Data Analytics College Project

<p>
This Project is a Data Analytics Web Application that will allow user to register and login to the website.<br>
Any user that has successfully login to Waver can then connect their social media accounts to view their analytics.
</p>
<p>
However we this project has a lot of complications:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook anayltics will only work for Facebook users that is an admin of National Irish Sailing School.<br>
    We have been using my partner's Facebook account for testing.</li>
<li>Since it is using Social Media APIs, It only works on a local host that is listening to port 80.<br>
    Trying to make it work while listening to other ports will require me to add it as 'Whitelist' on the developer app of the social media.<br>
    I have tried this with Facebook (which can now listen to port:8080) but no success in Google.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To Make this project run, you need to create a database called 'year3project'. Then import 'users.sql' file in the database.<br>
Facebook will only work with my partner's Facebook account. YouTube however, will work on any Google account with a youtube channel.
This project is not fully designed since we didn't have extra time to make it look better.
